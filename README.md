# NYSE_Analysis
In this project i used a data set containing financial performance data from companies listed in NYSE S&P and created
an incomce statement and forecasted financial metrics.


1 - the 1st sheet is the original data and you can see on the right some columns are colored in red that's where i did some formuals to get some new information.
For example, Gross Profit, Operating Profit, Gross Margin, and Operating Margin. 

2 - 2nd sheet i did a pivot table to answer my question which was "who spends more money on R&D in healthcare?" you can see the numbers on the table and i did 
a bar chart. and pharmaceuticals spends most money on research and development. 

3 - 3rd sheet i did a profit and loss statement, some operating statistics, and operating scenarios - sensitivity analysis.
and i did all of this with a ticker symbol to choose which company i want to see information about.
